First, I placed the Mac on an anti-static mat and secured the anti-static wristband to ensure I was grounded, preventing any static discharge that could potentially damage the motherboard or components.

<h2>Back Plate Removal</h2>

This particular Mac used P5 pentalobe screws. After carefully unscrewing each screw and safely storing them, I gently removed the back plate. It was moderately dusty and dirty, though not excessively considering its age. I cleaned off as much dust and dirt as possible.

<h2>Battery Disconnection</h2>

Next, I disconnected the battery connection to discharge it safely.

Locating the CPU next to the fan, I observed five screws securing the heat sink atop the CPU. Four were situated on top of the CPU, with one positioned near the fan. Soft mesh covered the screws on top of the CPU, which I removed before using a T5 screwdriver to unscrew them. For the lone screw near the fan, I utilized a 1.5 PH000 screwdriver.

I employed cotton swabs dipped in isopropyl alcohol to meticulously clean off the thermal paste from both the heat sink and CPU. Following the cleaning process, I applied a small rice-sized drop of thermal paste onto the CPU (referencing the official vendor website for recommended thermal paste). I then carefully reattached the heat sink, securing all five screws and reapplying the mesh cover. Once completed, I reconnected the battery cable, reattached the back cover, and securely fastened all screws back into place. I was succesfully careful!
